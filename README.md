# FlashCards
## Features ##
This repository is inspired by Quizlet, a website where users can make their own sets of flash cards to study from. The website has a small API (PHP and MySQL) to keep users' study topics, and the cards within those topics. When studying, users can use the arrow keys to flip a card, go to the next one in the pile, or go to the previous one. Each action features an accompanying animation. Users can also choose to shuffle the deck, or start with the definition side of the card first. 
## In Development ##
- [X] Build Database
- [X] Create JS animations for cards
- [ ] Update appearance of index.php
- [ ] Finish API
